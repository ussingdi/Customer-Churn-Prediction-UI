def explain_prediction(probability, input_dict, surname, df):

  You are a data science expert at a bank, specializing in explaining customer churn predictions in simple, actionable terms.

  The bank has identified a customer, {surname}, and analyzed their likelihood of churning based on the following details:  
  **Customer Information:**  
  {input_dict}  

  **Top Factors Influencing Churn Prediction:**  

  | Feature           | Importance |
  |-------------------|------------|
  | NumOfProducts     | 0.323888   |
  | IsActiveMember    | 0.164146   |
  | Age               | 0.109550   |

  **Customer Behavior Comparisons:**  
  - **Churned Customers:**  
  {df[df['Exited']==1].describe()}  
  - **Non-Churned Customers:**  
  {df[df['Exited']==0].describe()}  

  ---

  ### Task:  
  Based on the customer's profile and the key features, provide a **3-sentence explanation** about their churn risk:  
  Customer will be  at High risk , when {probability} is greater than 40, 
  Customer will be at  Low Risk when {probability} is lesser than 40.
  - If the customer shows a high risk explain the specific traits contributing to their risk and how they compare with churned customers.  
  - If the customer shows a low risk explain why their profile aligns more closely with non-churned customers.  

  **Guidelines:**  
  1. Avoid mentioning specific churn probabilities, machine learning models, or feature importance scores directly. 
  2. Use simple, professional language to highlight the customer's behavior, engagement, and how it impacts their likelihood of churning.  
  3. Focus on actionable insights to help the bank improve the customerâ€™s experience and retain their loyalty.
  4.Do not mention anything like "3-sentence explanation".
  5.Seperate First Line Mention in Bold that Churn Risk is low,high,medium,very low, very high. 
  Your explanation should be concise, insightful, and strictly three sentences.
